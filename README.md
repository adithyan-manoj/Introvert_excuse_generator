### Project Description
A Flutter mobile app integrated with a Flask backend that leverages Gemini API to provide advanced AI-powered features. The backend handles API requests securely, while the Flutter frontend offers a seamless user experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Introverts everywhere are suffering in silence‚Ä¶ mostly because they‚Äôre trying to avoid phone calls. Social invitations strike without warning, leaving them scrambling to invent excuses like ‚ÄúI have to wash my hair‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy pet rock isn‚Äôt feeling well.‚Äù Coming up with believable reasons on the spot is exhausting ‚Äî and frankly, we‚Äôd rather be in bed

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Introvert Excuse Generator swoops in like a socially awkward superhero, delivering instant, hilarious, and semi-plausible excuses for any unwanted interaction. Just tap a button and get gems like ‚ÄúSorry, my Wi-Fi is down and so is my will to go out‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to come, but my goldfish is having an existential crisis.‚Äù Now you can skip the small talk without breaking a sweat‚Ä¶ or your introvert pride.

(Add screenshot 1 here with proper name)
When you enter your situation and select the category‚Äîsuch as general, social, work, or family‚Äîyou also choose the tone you want, whether blunt, funny, or polite, along with the length of the excuse: short, medium, or long. Once you press the Generate Excuse button, the app takes all your choices and creates a fitting excuse tailored to your needs. It either crafts a quick, clever response or picks one from its collection based on your preferences. The generated excuse then appears instantly on your screen, giving you a perfect way to gracefully handle any awkward social moment.
